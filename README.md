Howdy lovelies,

Within this repo contains files and images necessary to describe the Substance Designer to TouchDesigner pipeline. Within you should expect the following files:

- Bricks.sbs -- Substance's working file that contains all nodes necessary to create a brick texture.
- Bricks.sbsar -- The published version of the .sbs. This is the file that would be imported into TouchDesigner via the Substance TOP
- Bricks_ambient_occlusion.png -- 1024x1024 raster image of the ambient occlusion map for the Substance Designer Bricks project
- Bricks_basecolor.png -- 1024x1024 raster image of the base color map for the Substance Designer Bricks project
- Bricks_height.png -- 1024x1024 raster image of the height map for the Substance Designer Bricks project
- Bricks_metallic.png -- 1024x1024 raster image of the metallic map for the Substance Designer Bricks project
- Bricks_normal.png -- 1024x1024 raster image of the normal map for the Substance Designer Bricks project
- Bricks_roughness.png -- 1024x1024 raster image of the roughness map for the Substance Designer Bricks project
- README.md -- This file
- substance_touch_pbr.tox -- A tox that contains three methods to transport substance's data into TouchDesigner, a base COMP that more or less shows the same type of node based work flow as Substance Designer the end result of which creates a brick texture, a render network comparing the quality of both TD's brick texture against Substance Designer's brick texture.

Thank you and enjoy,
